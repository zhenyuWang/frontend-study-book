There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\

C’mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta to be something wrong with him!\

So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\

Wait, does he eat chalk? Just, cause I don't want her to go through what I through with Carl.\

Ok, every body relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.\

Sounds like a date to me.\

Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\

Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\

Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone there.\

Instead of ...?\

That's right.\

Never had that dream.\

No.\

All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird because she never calls me!\

Hi!\

This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\

Are you okay, sweetie?\

I just fell like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out my mouth and tied it around my neck...\

Cookie?\

Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some coffee.\

Thanks.\

No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\

No, you don't.\

No, I don't, to tell with her, she left me!\

Alright Ross, look. You're felling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\

Strip joint! C’mon you're single! Have some hormones!\

I don't want to be single, okay? I just ... I just wanna be married again!\

And I just want a million dollars!\

Rachel?!\

Oh, God, Monica, hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\

Can I get you some coffee?\

De-caff.\

Okay, everybody, this is Rachel. another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey and you remember my brother Ross?\

Sure, hi!\

Hi!\

So you wanna tell us now or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\

Oh, God ... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden. Sweet 'n' Lo? I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but ... Anyway, I just had to get out of there and I started wondering "Why am I doing this? and who am I doing this for?" So anyway I just didn't know where to go and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived thre in the city.\

Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\

Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue ...
