Oh, God ... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden. Sweet 'n' Lo? I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but ... Anyway, I just had to get out of there and I started wondering "Why am I doing this? and who am I doing this for?" So anyway I just didn't know where to go and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived there in the city.\
噢，天哪，好吧，在婚礼前半小时，我在存放礼品的房间里，我看到调味汁瓶，它是一个如此漂亮的利摩日调味汁瓶。突然... 有糖吗？我意识到比起巴瑞，我更喜欢这个调味汁瓶。然后我真的吓坏了，我突然想到：巴瑞真的很像薯头先生(哈哈，这什么鬼)。我是说，我总是觉得他眼熟，但是... 不管怎么说，我必须离开那里然后我开始想：“我为什么要这样做？我这么做是为了谁？”不管怎么说，我不知道该去哪里，我知道我们有点疏远了，但是你是我在这个城市唯一认识的人\
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\

C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, "You're a shoe! You're a show, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!". And today I just stopped and I said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"\
好了，爸爸，听我说！这就好像，在我的一生中，所有人都告诉我 ”你是一只鞋子，你是一只鞋子，你是一只鞋子，你是一只鞋子！“，可今天我听下来说，”如果我不想做一只鞋子呢？如果我想做一个包包，或者一顶帽子呢？不，我不是想让你给我买帽子，我说我是一顶帽子，这是比喻拉，爸爸！“\
