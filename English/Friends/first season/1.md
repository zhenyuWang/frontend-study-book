There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\

C’mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta to be something wrong with him!\

So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\

Wait, does he eat chalk? Just, cause I don't want her to go through what I through with Carl.\

Ok, every body relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.\

Sounds like a date to me.\

Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\

Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\

Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone there.\

Instead of ...?\

That's right.\

Never had that dream.\

No.\

All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird because she never calls me!\

Hi!\

This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\

Are you okay, sweetie?\

I just fell like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out my mouth and tied it around my neck...\

Cookie?\

Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some coffee.\

Thanks.\

No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\

No, you don't.\

No, I don't, to tell with her, she left me!\

Alright Ross, look. You're felling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\

Strip joint! C’mon you're single! Have some hormones!\

I don't want to be single, okay? I just ... I just wanna be married again!\

And I just want a million dollars!\

Rachel?!\

Oh, God, Monica, hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\

Can I get you some coffee?\

De-caff.\

Okay, everybody, this is Rachel. another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey and you remember my brother Ross?\

Sure, hi!\

Hi!\

So you wanna tell us now or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\

Oh, God ... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden. Sweet 'n' Lo? I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but ... Anyway, I just had to get out of there and I started wondering "Why am I doing this? and who am I doing this for?" So anyway I just didn't know where to go and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived thre in the city.\

Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\

Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue ...\

Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\

Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\

Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\

I say push her down the stairs.\

Push her down the stairs!\

C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, "You're a shoe! You're a show, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!". And today I just stopped and I said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"\

You can see where he'd have trouble.\

Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\

Well, I guess we're established who's staying here with Monica...\

Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\

Just breathe, breathe... that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\

Rain drops on roses and rabbits and kittens bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens... La la la something and noodles with string. These are a few...\

I'm all better now.\

I helped!\

Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.\

And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\

Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\

What, like there's a rule or something?\

Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\

It's, uh, it's Paul.\

Buzz him in.\

Who is Paul?\

Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\

Maybe.\

Wait. Your'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\

He finally asked you out?\

Yes!\

Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\

Rach, wait, I can cancel...\

Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\

Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\

That'd be good...\

Really?\

No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\

Hi, come in! Paul, this is ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\

Hey! Paul!\

Hello!\

I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\

Okay, sit down. Two seconds.\

Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\

So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\

Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\

Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your    big lizards... Anyway, if you don't fell like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\

Yes, and we're very excited about it.\

Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\

Okay, sure.\

Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?\

Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
