Hi, guys!\
大家好！\
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!\
嗨，菲比！嗨！\
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?\
嗨，约会怎么样？\
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again.'\
嗯，不太好。他送我到地铁然后说“我们应该再来一次”。\
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?\
怎么了，他说“我们应该再来一次”，这不是很好吗？\
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'.\
不，大致翻译过来“我们应该再来一次”意思是“你永远不会看到我赤裸的”。\
Since when?\
什么时候这样子了？\
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.\
一直都是这样。这就像约会的语言。你知道，就像“不是你”的意思是“就是你”。\
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.\
或者“你是个好人”意思是“我会和穿皮衣的酒鬼约会，然后跟你抱怨他们”。\
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.\
还有，还有，“我想我们应该看看其他人”意思是“哈哈，我已经这样了”。\
And everybody knows this?\
大家都知道这些吗？\
Yeah. Cushions the blow.\
对，缓冲打击（就是这样拐弯说更不伤人）。\
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\
没错，就像你小时候，你父母把你的狗送去安乐死，然后告诉你它送去了农场养。\
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\
真有意思，不是，我是说我爸妈真的把我们的狗送去农场养了。\
Uh, Ross.\
额，罗斯。\
What? Wh- Hello? The Millners's farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, and horses, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- Oh, my God, Chi-Chi!\
怎么了？米尔纳家，在康涅狄格州，米尔纳家，他们有个超级棒的农场，还有马，还有兔子，它可以追兔子，那真是-哦，我的天，奇奇！\


"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"\
那么知道自己要死了有什么感觉？\
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."\
狱长，五分钟后我的痛苦就结束了。但你将要活在知道你让一个正直的人死去的痛苦中。\
Hey, that was really good!\
嘿，表演的真好！\
Yeah? Thanks! Let's keep going.\
真的吗？谢谢！我们继续吧。\
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"\
好的。“那么，你想从我这里得到什么，达蒙？”\
"I just wanna go back gto my cell. Cause in my cell, I can smoke."\
我只想回到我的牢房。因为在我的牢房里，我可以抽烟。\
"Smoke away."\
抽去吧。\
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.\
我想这可能就是为什么达蒙独自在牢房里抽烟的原因。\
What?\
怎么了？\
Relax your hand! Let your wrist go. Not so much! Alright, now try taking a puff. Alright. Okay. No. Give it to me.\
手放松！手腕放松。不要那么放松！好了，现在试着吸一口。好的。不行，给我。\
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.\
不，不，不，我不会给你香烟的。\
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. Alright, now. Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.\
没关系的，没关系。看，你想得到这个角色吗？想要吗？来。好了，现在。不要把它当成香烟。把它当成你手里缺失的东西。当你拿着它，你感觉很对。你感觉很满足。\
You miss it?\
你很想它吗？\
No, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh...my God.\
不，不是那么想。好了，现在我们抽烟。哦，我的天。
