Hi, guys!\
大家好！\
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!\
嗨，菲比！嗨！\
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?\
嗨，约会怎么样？\
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again.'\
嗯，不太好。他送我到地铁然后说“我们应该再来一次”。\
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?\
怎么了，他说“我们应该再来一次”，这不是很好吗？\
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'.\
不，大致翻译过来“我们应该再来一次”意思是“你永远不会看到我赤裸的”。\
Since when?\
什么时候这样子了？\
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.\
一直都是这样。这就像约会的语言。你知道，就像“不是你”的意思是“就是你”。\
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.\
或者“你是个好人”意思是“我会和穿皮衣的酒鬼约会，然后跟你抱怨他们”。\
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.\
还有，还有，“我想我们应该看看其他人”意思是“哈哈，我已经这样了”。\
And everybody knows this?\
大家都知道这些吗？\
Yeah. Cushions the blow.\
对，缓冲打击（就是这样拐弯说更不伤人）。\
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\
没错，就像你小时候，你父母把你的狗送去安乐死，然后告诉你它送去了农场养。\
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\
真有意思，不是，我是说我爸妈真的把我们的狗送去农场养了。\
Uh, Ross.\
额，罗斯。\
What? Wh- Hello? The Millners's farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, and horses, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- Oh, my God, Chi-Chi!\
怎么了？米尔纳家，在康涅狄格州，米尔纳家，他们有个超级棒的农场，还有马，还有兔子，它可以追兔子，那真是-哦，我的天，奇奇！\


"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"\
那么知道自己要死了有什么感觉？\
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."\
狱长，五分钟后我的痛苦就结束了。但你将要活在知道你让一个正直的人死去的痛苦中。\
Hey, that was really good!\
嘿，表演的真好！\
Yeah? Thanks! Let's keep going.\
真的吗？谢谢！我们继续吧。\
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"\
好的。“那么，你想从我这里得到什么，达蒙？”\
"I just wanna go back gto my cell. Cause in my cell, I can smoke."\
我只想回到我的牢房。因为在我的牢房里，我可以抽烟。\
"Smoke away."\
抽去吧。\
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.\
我想这可能就是为什么达蒙独自在牢房里抽烟的原因。\
What?\
怎么了？\
Relax your hand! Let your wrist go. Not so much! Alright, now try taking a puff. Alright. Okay. No. Give it to me.\
手放松！手腕放松。不要那么放松！好了，现在试着吸一口。好的。不行，给我。\
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.\
不，不，不，我不会给你香烟的。\
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. Alright, now. Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.\
没关系的，没关系。看，你想得到这个角色吗？想要吗？来。好了，现在。不要把它当成香烟。把它当成你手里缺失的东西。当你拿着它，你感觉很对。你感觉很满足。\
You miss it?\
你很想它吗？\
No, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh...my God.\
不，不是那么想。好了，现在我们抽烟。哦，我的天。


Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappuccino for Joey... Coffee black... Late... and an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!\
好吧，不要告诉我，别告诉我，无咖啡因卡布奇诺是乔伊的，黑咖啡，拿铁，冰茶。我在这方面越来越厉害了！\
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.\
是啊，真厉害。\
Good for me!\
我真行！\
Y'okay, Phoebe?\
菲比，你没事吧？\
Yeah no, I'm just, it's not even worth... It's my bank...\
嗯，不，只是，没啥大不了的，是我的银行……\
What did they do to you?\
他们对你怎么了？\
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT, and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.\
也没啥，只是，好吧，我在看我的邮件，然后打开了他们的月度，你知道，账单，然后我的账户里多了五百块钱。\
Easy, easy...\
放轻松，别激动……\
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...\
哦，撒旦的手下又在干坏事了……\
Yes, cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.\
是的，这下我要到银行找他们处理这个问题了。\
What are you talking about? Keep it!\
你在说什么呢？留着不就行了！\
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.\
这不是我的，不是我赚到的，如果我留着，就像是偷来的一样。\
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.\
是啊，但如果你花了它，就像是购物一样。\
Okay, okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? "Not mine, not mine, not mine." And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping-I'd hear "Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine."\
好吧，好吧，假设我买了一双很棒的鞋子。你知道我每走一步会听到什么吗？“不是我的，不是我的，不是我的。”即使我很开心，好吧，跳着走，我也会听到“不是不是我的，不是不是我的，不是不是我的。”\
We are with you. We got it.\
我们明白了。\
Okay. I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. Chandler, what're you doing?\
好吧，我永远都享受不了它。就像是一笔巨大的因果报应。钱德勒，你在干嘛？\
hey, what are you doing?\
嗨，你干嘛呢？\
Oh! Oh, God!\
哦，哦，天啊！\
What is this?\
这是什么？\
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.\
我在抽烟，我在抽烟，我在抽烟。\
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!\
哦，我真的不敢相信你，你一直都很好，三年了！\
And this is my reward!\
这就是我的奖励！\
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.\
等一下，好吗？想想你上次戒烟的经历。\
Okay, so this time I won't quit.\
所以这一次我不戒了。\
Ohhh! Put it out!\
哦，熄掉它！\
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.\
好吧，我熄掉了，我熄掉了。\
Oh, no! I can't drink this now!\
哦，不，这下我没法喝了！\
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.\
好了，我去换衣服了，有约会。\
So is it Alan again? How's it going?\
还是艾伦吗？进展如何？\
going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.\
进展的很不错。很好，我们很开心。\
So when do we get to meet the guy?\
那我们什么时候能见到他？\
Yeah!\
对啊！\
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.\
让我想想，今天是周一，永远不会。\
Oh, come on! come on!\
哦，拜托，别这样！\
No. Not after what happened with Steve.\
不行，不行，史蒂夫那次后就别想了。\
What are you talking about? We love Steve! Steve was sexy! Sorry.\
你在说什么呢？我们喜欢史蒂夫！史蒂夫很性感！抱歉。\
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.\
我自己都还不知道我对他的感觉。给我点时间弄清楚。\
Well, then can we meet him?\
好吧，然后我们就能见他了？\
No. Sorry.\
不，抱歉。
