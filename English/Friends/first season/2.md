What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\
你们男生不懂的是，对于我们女生，接吻的重要性不亚于任何一部分。\
Yeah, right!... Y'serious?\
是嘛，你们认真的？\
Oh, yeah!\
当然！\
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\
一个吻就能知道一切。\
Absolutely.\
没错。\
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\
对我们而言，接吻就像是开场表演，你知道吗？就像是在Pink Floyd出场前必须耐着性子看完脱口秀表演。\
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like comedian, it's that-that that's not why we bought the ticket.\
对，而且，我们并非讨厌搞笑表演，而是因为，我们买票又不是为了看脱口秀的。\
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\
问题在于，演唱会结束后，不管演出有多精彩，你们女生总还想再重温暖场脱口秀，你知道吗？就像是，交通拥堵时，我们开着车，只能拼命保持清醒。\
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise, next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\
是哦，给你个建议：让脱口秀回来吧。否则，下次你只能独自坐在家里，独自听那张唱片。\
Are we still talking about sex?\
咱们说的还是刚才的话题吗？



No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- Mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\
不，挺好的，挺好的，只是，不觉得她看起来有点生气吗？\
Well, she has issues.\
那是因为她有烦心事\
Does she?\
真的吗？\
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\

Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.' See?\

哦，应该是我的。我写了一个便条给自己，后来觉得不需要了，就把它揉成纸团了。。。现在我希望我死了（haha)\
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that--but, it's fine!\
那个枕头她已经拍过了，莫妮卡，你知道，你已经拍过了，但没关系\
Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\
抱歉，各位。我只是不想再给他们任何把柄\
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\
是的，众所周知父母对孩子枕头的平整度有多在意\

莫妮卡，嗨！莫妮卡，你吓到我了。我是说你现在一副慌张失措的样子，看起来不是很好\
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\

That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\
那是因为我的父母认为罗斯不会犯错，他是个完美的孩子。显然，他们在我出生前举行了一场盛大的仪式\

Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!'. Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\
还嫌我不够害怕吗？明天就要把它还给他了... “嗨，巴瑞！还记得我吗？我是那个穿着婚纱当着你全家人的面让你颜面无存的女孩 ！”天哪，现在我还要把戒指还给他，结果戒指没了，这更难了\

Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are, I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\
不要听你妈妈的。你独立自主，你一直都是！即使你还是个孩子...你胖乎乎的，没有朋友，你也很好！你会独自在房间里看书，做拼图...看，有些人像罗斯，他需要追求梦想，在博物馆工作，他的论文被发表。有些人满足于现状，我告诉你，这些人绝不会得癌症。我也听说过，一些女人想要拥有一切，我感谢上帝‘我们的小莫妮卡’似乎没有这个问题。\

Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey! I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\
你应该避免使用 ’甩‘ 这个词，很有可能他也是这样，这伤了男人的自尊，你应该不要看起来太好，我知道这很难。或者，我可以去那里，把戒指还给巴瑞，你可以和卡罗尔还有苏珊一起去妇科检查\
