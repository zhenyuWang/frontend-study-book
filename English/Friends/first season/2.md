What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\
你们男生不懂的是，对于我们女生，接吻的重要性不亚于任何一部分。\
Yeah, right!... Y'serious?\
是嘛，你们认真的？\
Oh, yeah!\
当然！\
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\
一个吻就能知道一切。\
Absolutely.\
没错。\
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\
对我们而言，接吻就像是开场表演，你知道吗？就像是在Pink Floyd出场前必须耐着性子看完脱口秀表演。\
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like comedian, it's that-that that's not why we bought the ticket.\
对，而且，我们并非讨厌搞笑表演，而是因为，我们买票又不是为了看脱口秀的。\
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\
问题在于，演唱会结束后，不管演出有多精彩，你们女生总还想再重温暖场脱口秀，你知道吗？就像是，交通拥堵时，我们开着车，只能拼命保持清醒。\
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise, next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\
是哦，给你个建议：让脱口秀回来吧。否则，下次你只能独自坐在家里，独自听那张唱片。\
Are we still talking about sex?\
咱们说的还是刚才的话题吗？



No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- Mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\
不，挺好的，挺好的，只是，不觉得她看起来有点生气吗？\
Well, she has issues.\
那是因为她有烦心事\
Does she?\
真的吗？\
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\
他在外面用棒敲敲打其他女人的头，而她在家里努力把地毯上的乳齿象味道弄掉！(前半句...)\
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.' See?\
玛莎，他们是原始人，好吗？他们的问题应该是“哇，冰川时代离我们越来越近了”，明白吗？\
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\
说到问题，那不是你前妻吗？\
Me? No.\
我吗？不是\
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\
正是，卡罗尔，你好\
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is. How about I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age?\
好吧，是的。咱们到冰河世纪那边见好吗？\
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\
你看起来气色很好，我...虽然我很不喜欢\
Sorry. thanks. You look good too.\
对不起，谢谢。我看起来也很不错\
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect...\
在这里，任何直立的人（没懂这句话）\
Why are you here, Carol?\
卡罗尔，你来找我有什么事？\
I'm pregnant.\
我怀孕了\
pregnant?!\
怀孕？！

Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.\
这里是句电视剧台词：她似乎不急着离开\
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\
我猜这是《三人行》里他们有误会的一集\
Then I've already seen this one!\
那我看过这一集了\
Are you through with that?\
你喝完了吗？\
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\
嗯，对不起，我咽得太慢了\
Whose little ball of paper is this?!\
这是谁的小纸团？\
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realized I didn't need it, so I balled it up and ... now I wish I was dead.\
哦，应该是我的。我写了一个便条给自己，后来觉得不需要了，就把它揉成纸团了。。。现在我希望我死了（haha)\
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that--but, it's fine!\
那个枕头她已经拍过了，莫妮卡，你知道，你已经拍过了，但没关系\
Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\
抱歉，各位。我只是不想再给他们任何把柄\
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\
是的，众所周知父母对孩子枕头的平整度有多在意\
Monica? Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly, you know. And not-not in a good way.\
莫妮卡，嗨！莫妮卡，你吓到我了。我是说你现在一副慌张失措的样子，看起来不是很好\
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\
对啊，放松。你看罗斯，每次他们来他都不会慌张失措\
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\
那是因为我的父母认为罗斯不会犯错，他是个完美的孩子。显然，他们在我出生前举行了一场盛大的仪式\
What?\
怎么了？\

Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\
有人见过我的订婚戒指吗？\
Yeah, it's beautiful.\
是的，它很漂亮\
Oh God, Oh God,Oh God, Oh God,Oh God, Oh God,Oh God.\
天哪 天哪 天哪 天哪 天哪 天哪\
No, look, don't touch that!\
嘿，不要动它们\
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!'. Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\
还嫌我不够害怕吗？明天就要把它还给他了... “嗨，巴瑞！还记得我吗？我是那个穿着婚纱当着你全家人的面让你颜面无存的女孩 ！”天哪，现在我还要把戒指还给他，结果戒指没了，这更难了\
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!\
别急，瑞秋，我们会找到的，对吧！\
Oh! Yeah!\
哦，当然！\
Ok, look.\
找吧\
Alright, when do you have it on last?\
最后一次戴是什么时候？\
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\
呆子，当然是在她丢失之前！\

Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\
不过这面条煮的还真直\
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\
莫妮卡，你明白的，在千层面里找订婚戒指不是这样找的\
I just... can't do it.\
我只是。。。我做不到\
Boys? We're going in.\
伙计们，动手吧\
Hi...\

Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\
是的，当你这样两个小时，你就会变成我现在这样了\
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\
如此一来，就不用操心枕头的事了对吧？\
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\
那现在，你要怎么办？\
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have be to involved... basically it's totally up to me.\
卡罗尔说他和苏珊想让我参与进来，但是如果我觉得不舒服，我就不用参与进来...基本上这完全取决于我\
She is so great! I miss her.\
她真好，我真想念她\
What does she mean by 'involved'?\
‘参与进来’ 的意思是什么？\
