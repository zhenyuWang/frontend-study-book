What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\
你们男生不懂的是，对于我们女生，接吻的重要性不亚于任何一部分。\
Yeah, right!... Y'serious?\
是嘛，你们认真的？\
Oh, yeah!\
当然！\
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\
一个吻就能知道一切。\
Absolutely.\
没错。\
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\
对我们而言，接吻就像是开场表演，你知道吗？就像是在Pink Floyd出场前必须耐着性子看完脱口秀表演。\
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like comedian, it's that-that that's not why we bought the ticket.\
对，而且，我们并非讨厌搞笑表演，而是因为，我们买票又不是为了看脱口秀的。\
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\
问题在于，演唱会结束后，不管演出有多精彩，你们女生总还想再重温暖场脱口秀，你知道吗？就像是，交通拥堵时，我们开着车，只能拼命保持清醒。\
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise, next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\
是哦，给你个建议：让脱口秀回来吧。否则，下次你只能独自坐在家里，独自听那张唱片。\
Are we still talking about sex?\
咱们说的还是刚才的话题吗？
