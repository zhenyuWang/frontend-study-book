# Start a New React Project
If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.\
eventually [ɪˈventʃuəli] adv. 最终，终于；

By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.\
essentially [ɪˈsenʃəli] adv. 本质上，基本上；

## Production-grade React frameworks
These frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production and are working towards supporting our full-stack architecture vision. All of the frameworks we recommend are open source with active communities for support, and can be deployed to your own server or a hosting provider. If you’re a framework author interested in being included on this list, please let us know.\
architecture [ˈɑːrkɪtektʃə(r)] n. 构造；体系；\
vision [ˈvɪʒn] n. 视力；视觉；幻想；愿望；愿景；

## Next.js
[Next.js’ Pages Router](https://nextjs.org) is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:\
versatile [ˈvɜːrsətl] adj. 多才多艺的；多方面的；多功能的；\
mostly [ˈməʊstli] adv. 大部分；主要地；
```
npx create-next-app@latest
```
If you’re new to Next.js, check out the [learn Next.js course](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Next.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a static export which doesn’t require a server.
