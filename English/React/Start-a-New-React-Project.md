# Start a New React Project
If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.

You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.\
eventually [ɪˈventʃuəli] adv. 最终，终于；

By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.\
essentially [ɪˈsenʃəli] adv. 本质上，基本上；

## Production-grade React frameworks
These frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production and are working towards supporting our full-stack architecture vision. All of the frameworks we recommend are open source with active communities for support, and can be deployed to your own server or a hosting provider. If you’re a framework author interested in being included on this list, please let us know.\
architecture [ˈɑːrkɪtektʃə(r)] n. 构造；体系；\
