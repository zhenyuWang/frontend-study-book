# Add React to an Existing Project
If you want to add some interactivity to your existing project, you don’t have to rewrite it in React. Add React to your existing stack, and render interactive React components anywhere.

**Note:**\
You need to install Node.js for local development. Although you can try React online or with a simple HTML page, realistically most JavaScript tooling you’ll want to use for development requires Node.js.\
realistically [ˌrɪəˈlɪstɪkli] 现实地；实际地；逼真地
