# Synchronizing with Effects
Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

- How Effects are different from events
- How to declare an Effect in your component
- How to skip re-running an Effect unnecessarily
- Why Effects run twice in development and how to fix them

## What are Effects and how are they different from events?
Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:

- Rendering code (introduced in Describing the UI) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.

- Event handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain “side effects” (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).

Sometimes this isn’t enough. Consider a `ChatRoom` component that must connect to the chat server whenever it’s visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it’s a side effect) so it can’t happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes `ChatRoom` to be displayed.\
particular [/pərˈtɪkjələr/] 特定的，特殊的

Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).\
specify [/ˈspɛsɪfaɪ/] 指定，明确说明\

**Note**\
Here and later in this text, capitalized “Effect” refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering. To refer to the broader programming concept, we’ll say “side effect”.\
broader [/ˈbrɔːdər/] 更广泛的，宽广的

## You might not need an Effect
Don’t rush to add Effects to your components. Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to “step out” of your React code and synchronize with some external system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.\
rush [/rʌʃ/] 匆忙，急于\
typically [/ˈtɪpɪkli/] 通常，典型地

## How to write an Effect
To write an Effect, follow these three steps:

1. Declare an Effect. By default, your Effect will run after every commit.
2. Specify the Effect dependencies. Most Effects should only re-run when needed rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying dependencies.
3. Add cleanup if needed. Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, “connect” needs “disconnect”, “subscribe” needs “unsubscribe”, and “fetch” needs either “cancel” or “ignore”. You will learn how to do this by returning a cleanup function.

Let’s look at each of these steps in detail.

### Step 1: Declare an Effect
To declare an Effect in your component, import the `useEffect` Hook from React:
```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```
Then, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect:
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here will run after *every* render
  });
  return <div />;
}
```
Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside `useEffect`. In other words, `useEffect` “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.

Let’s see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a `<VideoPlayer>` React component. It would be nice to control whether it’s playing or paused by passing an `isPlaying` prop to it:
```jsx
<VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} />;
```
Your custom `VideoPlayer` component renders the built-in browser `<video>` tag:
```jsx
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  // TODO: do something with isPlaying
  return <video src={src} />;
}
```
However, the browser `<video>` tag does not have an `isPlaying` prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the `play()` and `pause()` methods on the DOM element. You need to synchronize the value of `isPlaying` prop, which tells whether the video should currently be playing, with calls like `play()` and `pause()`.\
manually [/ˈmænjuəli/] 手动地，人工地

We’ll need to first get a ref to the `<video>` DOM node.

You might be tempted to try to call `play()` or `pause()` during rendering, but that isn’t correct:
```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  if (isPlaying) {
    ref.current.play();  // Calling these while rendering isn't allowed.
  } else {
    ref.current.pause(); // Also, this crashes.
  }

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
The reason this code isn’t correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, rendering should be a pure calculation of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.

Moreover, when `VideoPlayer` is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn’t a DOM node yet to call `play()` or `pause()` on, because React doesn’t know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.

The solution here is to wrap the side effect with `useEffect` to move it out of the rendering calculation:
```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}
```
By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.

When your `VideoPlayer` component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the `<video>` tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call `play()` or `pause()` depending on the value of `isPlaying`.

Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the `isPlaying` value:
```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
In this example, the “external system” you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.\
declarative [/dɪˈklærətɪv/] 声明式的，声明的

Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling `play()` may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.\
incomplete [/ˌɪnkəmˈpliːt/] 不完整的，未完成的

**Pitfall**\
By default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop:\
produce [/prəˈdjuːs/] 产生，导致\
infinite [/ˈɪnfɪnɪt/] 无限的，无穷的
```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
});
```
Effects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.\
outlet [/ˈaʊtlet/] 插座，出口

Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If there’s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.

### Step 2: Specify the Effect dependencies
By default, Effects run after every render. Often, this is not what you want:

- Sometimes, it’s slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it’s necessary. For example, you don’t want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke.
- Sometimes, it’s wrong. For example, you don’t want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.

necessary [/ˈnɛsəˌsɛri/] 必要的，必需的\
keystroke [/ˈkiːstroʊk/] 按键，击键

To demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few `console.log` calls and a text input that updates the parent component’s state. Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:\
demonstrate [/ˈdɛmənstreɪt/] 演示，证明
```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
You can tell React to skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the `useEffect` call. Start by adding an empty `[]` array to the above example on line 14:
```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
	```
You should see an error saying `React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'`:
```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, []); // This causes an error

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
The problem is that the code inside of your Effect depends on the `isPlaying` prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add `isPlaying` to the dependency array:
```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) { // It's used here...
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here!
	```
Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying `[isPlaying]` as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if `isPlaying` is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn’t cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:\
specifying [/spəˈsɪfaɪɪŋ/] 指定，明确说明
```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if all of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the `Object.is` comparison. See the `useEffect` reference for details.

Notice that you can’t “choose” your dependencies. You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don’t match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don’t want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not “need” that dependency.

**Pitfall**\
The behaviors without the dependency array and with an empty `[]` dependency array are different:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after every render
});

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs only on mount (when the component appears)
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs on mount *and also* if either a or b have changed since the last render
}, [a, b]);
```
We’ll take a close look at what “mount” means in the next step.

#### Why was the ref omitted from the dependency array?
imit [/ɪˈmɪt/] 省略，遗漏\
This Effect uses both ref and `isPlaying`, but only `isPlaying` is declared as a dependency:
```jsx
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);
```
This is because the `ref` object has a stable identity: React guarantees you’ll always get the same object from the same `useRef` call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too:\
stable [/ˈsteɪbəl/] 稳定的，牢固的\
identity [/aɪˈdɛntɪti/] 身份，特性\
guarantee [/ˌɡærənˈtiː/] 保证，担保\
therefore [/ˈðerfɔːr/] 因此，所以
```jsx
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying, ref]);
```
The set functions returned by `useState` also have stable identity, so you will often see them omitted from the dependencies too. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do.

Omitting always-stable dependencies only works when the linter can “see” that the object is stable. For example, if ref was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array. However, this is good because you can’t know whether the parent component always passes the same ref, or passes one of several refs conditionally. So your Effect would depend on which ref is passed.\
conditionally [/kənˈdɪʃənəli/] 有条件地，视情况而定

### Step 3: Add cleanup if needed
Consider a different example. You’re writing a `ChatRoom` component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a `createConnection()` API that returns an object with `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user?

Start by writing the Effect logic:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
});
```
It would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
}, []);
```
The code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is `[]` (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component “mounts”, i.e. appears on the screen for the first time.

Let’s try running this code:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;
}
// Chat.js
export function createConnection() {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected.');
    }
  };
}
```
This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect `"✅ Connecting..."` to be printed once in the console. However, if you check the console, `"✅ Connecting..."` gets printed twice. Why does it happen?

Imagine the `ChatRoom` component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the `ChatRoom` page. The component mounts and calls `connection.connect()`. Then imagine the user navigates to another screen—for example, to the Settings page. The `ChatRoom` component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and `ChatRoom` mounts again. This would set up a second connection—but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.\
journey [/ˈdʒɜːrni/] 旅程，旅行\
piling up [/ˈpaɪlɪŋ ʌp/] 堆积，积累

Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.\
extensive [/ɪkˈstɛnsɪv/] 广泛的，全面的\
manual [/ˈmænjuəl/] 手动的，人工的

Seeing the `"✅ Connecting..."` log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn’t close the connection when the component unmounts.

To fix the issue, return a cleanup function from your Effect:
```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);
  ```
React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let’s see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;
}
// Chat.js
export function createConnection() {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected.');
    }
  };
}
```
Now you get three console logs in development:

1. "✅ Connecting..."
2. "❌ Disconnected."
3. "✅ Connecting..."

This is the correct behavior in development. By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There’s an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal—don’t try to make it go away!\
verify [/ˈvɛrɪfaɪ/] 验证，核实\
probe [/proʊb/] 探测，探查

In production, you would only see "✅ Connecting..." printed once. Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off Strict Mode to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above.

## How to handle the Effect firing twice in development?
React intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. The right question isn’t “how to run an Effect once”, but “how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting”.\
intentionally [/ɪnˈtɛnʃənəli/] 故意地，蓄意地

Usually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as you’d see in development).\
implement [/ˈɪmplɪˌmɛnt/] 实现，执行\
distinguish [/dɪˈstɪŋɡwɪʃ/] 区分，辨别

Most of the Effects you’ll write will fit into one of the common patterns below.

**Pitfall**\
**Don’t use refs to prevent Effects from firing**\
A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a `ref` to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could “fix” the above bug with a `useRef`:\
pitfall [/ˈpɪtˌfɔːl/] 陷阱，错误\
```jsx
const connectionRef = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
  // 🚩 This wont fix the bug!!!
  if (!connectionRef.current) {
    connectionRef.current = createConnection();
    connectionRef.current.connect();
  }
}, []);
```
This makes it so you only see `"✅ Connecting..."` once in development, but it doesn’t fix the bug.

When the user navigates away, the connection still isn’t closed and when they navigate back, a new connection is created. As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up, the same as it would before the “fix”.

To fix the bug, it is not enough to just make the Effect run once. The effect needs to work after re-mounting, which means the connection needs to be cleaned up like in the solution above.

See the examples below for how to handle common patterns.

## Controlling non-React widgets
Sometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren’t written in React. For example, let’s say you’re adding a map component to your page. It has a `setZoomLevel()` method, and you’d like to keep the zoom level in sync with a `zoomLevel` state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const map = mapRef.current;
  map.setZoomLevel(zoomLevel);
}, [zoomLevel]);
```
Note that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling `setZoomLevel` twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn’t matter because it won’t remount needlessly in production.

Some APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the `showModal` method of the built-in `<dialog>` element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const dialog = dialogRef.current;
  dialog.showModal();
  return () => dialog.close();
}, []);
```
In development, your Effect will call `showModal()`, then immediately `close()`, and then `showModal()` again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `showModal()` once, as you would see in production.

## Subscribing to events
If your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  function handleScroll(e) {
    console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY);
  }
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```
In development, your Effect will call `addEventListener()`, then immediately `removeEventListener()`, and then `addEventListener()` again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `addEventListener()` once, as in production.

## Triggering animations
If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const node = ref.current;
  node.style.opacity = 1; // Trigger the animation
  return () => {
    node.style.opacity = 0; // Reset to the initial value
  };
}, []);
```
In development, opacity will be set to `1`, then to `0`, and then to `1` again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to `1` directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state.\
tweening [/ˈtwiːnɪŋ/] 插值动画，补间动画\
timeline [/ˈtaɪmˌlaɪn/] 时间线，时间轴
