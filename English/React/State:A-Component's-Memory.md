# State: A Component's Memory
Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.

- What pair of values the useState Hook returns
- How to add more than one state variable
- Why state is called local

## When a regular variable isn’t enough
Here’s a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the “Next” button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to `1`, then `2`, and so on. However, this won’t work (you can try it!):\
sculpture [/ˈskʌlptʃər/] 雕像，雕塑作品；雕刻艺术，雕塑艺术；
```jsx
// App.js
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

```
The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:

1. Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

persist [/pərˈsɪst/] v. 持续存在\
from scratch 从头开始

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. Retain the data between renders.
2. Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

retain [rɪˈteɪn] v. 保持，保留；记住

The useState Hook provides those two things:

1. A state variable to retain the data between renders.
2. A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
