# State: A Component's Memory
Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.

## When a regular variable isn’t enough
Here’s a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the “Next” button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to `1`, then `2`, and so on. However, this won’t work (you can try it!):\

```
The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:

1. Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

persist [/pərˈsɪst/] v. 持续存在\
from scratch 从头开始

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. Retain the data between renders.
2. Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

retain [rɪˈteɪn] v. 保持，保留；记住

The useState Hook provides those two things:

1. A state variable to retain the data between renders.
2. A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

## Adding a state variable
To add a state variable, import `useState` from React at the top of the file:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```
Then, replace this line:
```jsx
let index = 0;
```
with
```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
index is a state variable and setIndex is the setter function.
```
`index` is a state variable and `setIndex` is the setter function.

The [ and ] syntax here is called array destructuring and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.\
destructuring [dɪˈstrʌktʃərɪŋ] n. 解构

This is how they work together in `handleClick`:
```jsx
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```
Now clicking the “Next” button switches the current sculpture:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>

### Meet your first Hook
In React, `useState`, as well as any other function starting with “`use`”, is called a Hook.

Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features.

State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.

**Pitfall**\
Hooks—functions starting with use—can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.

### Anatomy of useState
When you call useState, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:
```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```
In this case, you want React to remember `index`.

**Note**\
The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

The only argument to `useState` is the initial value of your state variable. In this example, the `index`’s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`.

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The state variable (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The state setter function (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

Here’s how that happens in action:
```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```
1. Your component renders the first time. Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. You update the state. When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it’s `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. Your component’s second render. React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React remembers that you set index to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

## Giving a component multiple state variables
You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that’s toggled when you click “Show details”:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

```
It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read Choosing the State Structure for more tips.

## State is isolated and private
State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:
```jsx
// App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
// Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>

      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn’t “know” anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.\
impact [ˈɪmpækt] v. 影响

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to remove state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components.

## Recap
- Use a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders.
- State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
- Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you “hook into” React features like state.
- Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
- The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
- You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
- State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.
