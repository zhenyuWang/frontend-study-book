# Adding Interactivity
Some things on the screen update in response to user input. For example, clicking an image gallery switches the active image. In React, data that changes over time is called state. You can add state to any component, and update it as needed. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to write components that handle interactions, update their state, and display different output over time.

In this chapter
- How to handle user-initiated events
- How to make components “remember” information with state
- How React updates the UI in two phases
- Why state doesn’t update right after you change it
- How to queue multiple state updates
- How to update an object in state
- How to update an array in state

initiate [ɪˈnɪʃieɪt]: v. 开始，发起
queue [kjuː]: v. 排队，排队等候

## Responding to events
React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to user interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and so on.

Built-in components like `<button>` only support built-in browser events like `onClick`. However, you can also create your own components, and give their event handler props any application-specific names that you like.
```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing!')}
      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')}
    />
  );
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```
