# Installation

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.\
gradual [ˈɡrædʒuəl] adj. 逐渐的，渐进的；\
adoption [əˈdɒpʃn] n. 采纳，采用；

## Try React
You don’t need to install anything to play with React. Try editing this sandbox!

You can edit it directly or open it in a new tab by pressing the “Fork” button in the upper right corner.

Most pages in the React documentation contain sandboxes like this. Outside of the React documentation, there are many online sandboxes that support React: for example, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, or CodePen.
