# Preserving and Resetting State
State is isolated between components. React keeps track of which state belongs to which component based on their place in the UI tree. You can control when to preserve state and when to reset it between re-renders.\

## State is tied to a position in the render tree
React builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.

When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.

Here, there is only one `<Counter />` JSX tag, but it’s rendered at two different positions:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const counter = <Counter />;
  return (
    <div>
      {counter}
      {counter}
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. You don’t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.

In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two `Counter` components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, `score` and `hover` states.

Try clicking both counters and notice they don’t affect each other:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
As you can see, when one counter is updated, only the state for that component is updated:

React will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree. To see this, increment both counters, then remove the second component by unchecking “Render the second counter” checkbox, and then add it back by ticking it again:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [showB, setShowB] = useState(true);
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      {showB && <Counter />} 
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showB}
          onChange={e => {
            setShowB(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Render the second counter
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Notice how the moment you stop rendering the second counter, its state disappears completely. That’s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state.

When you tick “Render the second counter”, a second `Counter` and its state are initialized from scratch `(score = 0)` and added to the DOM.

React preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.\
