# Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks
React comes with several built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.

**You will learn**
- What custom Hooks are, and how to write your own
- How to reuse logic between components
- How to name and structure your custom Hooks
- When and why to extract custom Hooks

## Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components
Imagine you’re developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you’ll need two things in your component:

1. A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
2. An Effect that subscribes to the global `online` and `offline` events, and updates that state.

This will keep your component synchronized with the network status. You might start with something like this:
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}
```
Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this `StatusBar` updates in response to your actions.

Now imagine you also want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a `Save` button that will become disabled and show “Reconnecting…” instead of “Save” while the network is off.

To start, you can copy and paste the `isOnline` state and the Effect into `SaveButton`:
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```
Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.

These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different visual appearance, you want to reuse the logic between them.

### Extracting your own custom Hook from a component 
Imagine for a moment that, similar to useState and useEffect, there was a built-in `useOnlineStatus` Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:
```jsx
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```
Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called `useOnlineStatus` and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:
```jsx
function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```
At the end of the function, return `isOnline`. This lets your components read that value:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </>
  );
}
// useOnlineStatus.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```
Verify that switching the network on and off updates both components.

Now your components don’t have as much repetitive logic. More importantly, the code inside them describes what they want to do (use the online status!) rather than how to do it (by subscribing to the browser events).

When you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.

### Hook names always start with use 
React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You’ll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!\
occasionally [/əˈkeɪʒ(ə)nəli/] 偶尔

You must follow these naming conventions:

1. React component names must start with a capital letter, like `StatusBar` and `SaveButton`. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.
2. Hook names must start with `use` followed by a capital letter, like `useState` (built-in) or `useOnlineStatus` (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.

This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might “hide”. For example, if you see a `getColor()` function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can’t possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn’t start with `use`. However, a function call like `useOnlineStatus()` will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!\
convention [/kənˈvɛnʃ(ə)n/] 约定，惯例\
guarantee [/ˌɡærənˈtiː/] 保证\

**Note**\
If your linter is configured for React, it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename `useOnlineStatus` to `getOnlineStatus`. Notice that the linter won’t allow you to call `useState` or `useEffect` inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!

#### Should all functions called during rendering start with the use prefix?
No. Functions that don’t call Hooks don’t need to be Hooks.

If your function doesn’t call any Hooks, avoid the `use` prefix. Instead, write it as a regular function without the `use` prefix. For example, `useSorted` below doesn’t call Hooks, so call it `getSorted` instead:
```jsx
// 🔴 Avoid: A Hook that doesn't use Hooks
function useSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}

// ✅ Good: A regular function that doesn't use Hooks
function getSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}
```
This ensures that your code can call this regular function anywhere, including conditions:
```jsx
function List({ items, shouldSort }) {
  let displayedItems = items;
  if (shouldSort) {
    // ✅ It's ok to call getSorted() conditionally because it's not a Hook
    displayedItems = getSorted(items);
  }
  // ...
}
```
You should give `use` prefix to a function (and thus make it a Hook) if it uses at least one Hook inside of it:
```jsx
// ✅ Good: A Hook that uses other Hooks
function useAuth() {
  return useContext(Auth);
}
```
Technically, this isn’t enforced by React. In principle, you could make a Hook that doesn’t call other Hooks. This is often confusing and limiting so it’s best to avoid that pattern. However, there may be rare cases where it is helpful. For example, maybe your function doesn’t use any Hooks right now, but you plan to add some Hook calls to it in the future. Then it makes sense to name it with the `use` prefix:
```jsx
// ✅ Good: A Hook that will likely use some other Hooks later
function useAuth() {
  // TODO: Replace with this line when authentication is implemented:
  // return useContext(Auth);
  return TEST_USER;
}
```
Then components won’t be able to call it conditionally. This will become important when you actually add Hook calls inside. If you don’t plan to use Hooks inside it (now or later), don’t make it a Hook.

### Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself
In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it’s wrong to think that a single `isOnline` state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:
```jsx
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```
It works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:\
extract [/ɪkˈstrækt/] 提取\
duplication [/ˌduːplɪˈkeɪʃ(ə)n/] 重复
```jsx
function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```
These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).

To better illustrate this, we’ll need a different example. Consider this `Form` component:\
illustrate [/ˈɪləsˌtreɪt/] 说明，阐明
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
```
There’s some repetitive logic for each form field:

1. There’s a piece of state (`firstName` and `lastName`).
2. There’s a change handler (`handleFirstNameChange` and `handleLastNameChange`).
3. There’s a piece of JSX that specifies the `value` and `onChange` attributes for that input.

You can extract the repetitive logic into this `useFormInput` custom Hook:
```jsx
// App.js
import { useFormInput } from './useFormInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input {...firstNameProps} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input {...lastNameProps} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstNameProps.value} {lastNameProps.value}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
// useFormInput.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export function useFormInput(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  function handleChange(e) {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  }

  const inputProps = {
    value: value,
    onChange: handleChange
  };

  return inputProps;
}
```
Notice that it only declares one state variable called `value`.

However, the `Form` component calls `useFormInput` two times:
```jsx
function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');
  // ...
```
This is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!

Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic but not state itself. Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook. This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you’d like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.

When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, lift it up and pass it down instead.

## Passing reactive values between Hooks 
The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks need to be pure. Think of custom Hooks’ code as part of your component’s body!

Because custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:
```jsx
// ChatRoom.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
When you change `serverUrl` or `roomId`, the Effect “reacts” to your changes and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect’s dependencies.

Now move the Effect’s code into a custom Hook:
```jsx
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```
This lets your `ChatRoom` component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:
```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
This looks much simpler! (But it does the same thing.)

Notice that the logic still responds to prop and state changes. Try editing the server URL or the selected room:
```jsx
// ChatRoom.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
Notice how you’re taking the return value of one Hook:
```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```
and passing it as an input to another Hook:
```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```
Every time your `ChatRoom` component re-renders, it passes the latest `roomId` and `serverUrl` to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It’s as if the output of `useState` “feeds into” the input of the `useChatRoom`.)

### Passing event handlers to custom Hooks
**Under Construction**\
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.

As you start using `useChatRoom` in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:\
hardcode [/ˈhɑːdˌkəʊd/] 硬编码
```jsx
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
Let’s say you want to move this logic back to your component:

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    onReceiveMessage(msg) {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    }
  });
  // ...
```
To make this work, change your custom Hook to take `onReceiveMessage` as one of its named options:
```jsx
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onReceiveMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```
This will work, but there’s one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.\
improvement [/ɪmˈpruːvmənt/] 改进

Adding a dependency on onReceiveMessage is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:\
ideal [/aɪˈdɪəl/] 理想的
```jsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';
// ...

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```
Now the chat won’t re-connect every time that the `ChatRoom` component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:
```jsx
// ChatRoom.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    onReceiveMessage(msg) {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    }
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
Notice how you no longer need to know how `useChatRoom` works in order to use it. You could add it to any other component, pass any other options, and it would work the same way. That’s the power of custom Hooks.

## When to use custom Hooks
You don’t need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a `useFormInput` Hook to wrap a single `useState` call like earlier is probably unnecessary.

However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn’t need Effects very often, so if you’re writing one, it means that you need to “step outside React” to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn’t have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.

For example, consider a `ShippingForm` component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:
```jsx
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches cities for a country
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]);

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]);

  // ...
```
Although this code is quite repetitive, it’s correct to keep these Effects separate from each other. They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn’t merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the `ShippingForm` component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own useData Hook:
```jsx
function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (url) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setData(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [url]);
  return data;
}
```
Now you can replace both Effects in the `ShippingForm` components with calls to `useData`:
```jsx
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);
  // ...
```
Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the `url` in and you get the `data` out. By “hiding” your Effect inside `useData`, you also prevent someone working on the `ShippingForm` component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it. With time, most of your app’s Effects will be in custom Hooks.

### Keep your custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases
Start by choosing your custom Hook’s name. If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component’s logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.\
struggle to [/ˈstrʌɡ(ə)l/] 难以；努力做某事

Ideally, your custom Hook’s name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn’t write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:

- ✅ `useData(url)`
- ✅ `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)`
- ✅ `useChatRoom(options)`

When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system. It’s good as long as it would be clear to a person familiar with that system:\
jargon [ˈdʒɑːrɡən] 行话；术语

- ✅ `useMediaQuery(query)`
- ✅ `useSocket(url)`
- ✅ `useIntersectionObserver(ref, options)`

Keep custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases. Avoid creating and using custom “lifecycle” Hooks that act as alternatives and convenience wrappers for the `useEffect` API itself:

- 🔴 `useMount(fn)`
- 🔴 `useEffectOnce(fn)`
- 🔴 `useUpdateEffect(fn)`

For example, this `useMount` Hook tries to ensure some code only runs “on mount”:
```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // 🔴 Avoid: using custom "lifecycle" Hooks
  useMount(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });
    connection.connect();

    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });
  });
  // ...
}

// 🔴 Avoid: creating custom "lifecycle" Hooks
function useMount(fn) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fn();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'
}
```
Custom “lifecycle” Hooks like `useMount` don’t fit well into the React paradigm. For example, this code example has a mistake (it doesn’t “react” to `roomId` or `serverUrl` changes), but the linter won’t warn you about it because the linter only checks direct `useEffect` calls. It won’t know about your Hook.

If you’re writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:
```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Good: two raw Effects separated by purpose

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat', roomId });
  }, [roomId]);

  // ...
}
```
Then, you can (but don’t have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:
```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose
  useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId });
  useImpressionLog('visit_chat', { roomId });
  // ...
}
```
A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does. For example, `useChatRoom(options)` can only connect to the chat room, while `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)` can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn’t constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it’s likely to introduce more problems than it solves.
