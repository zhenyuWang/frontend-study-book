# Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks
React comes with several built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.

## Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components
Imagine you’re developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you’ll need two things in your component:

1. A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
2. An Effect that subscribes to the global `online` and `offline` events, and updates that state.

This will keep your component synchronized with the network status. You might start with something like this:
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}
```
Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this `StatusBar` updates in response to your actions.

Now imagine you also want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a `Save` button that will become disabled and show “Reconnecting…” instead of “Save” while the network is off.

To start, you can copy and paste the `isOnline` state and the Effect into `SaveButton`:
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```
Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.

These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different visual appearance, you want to reuse the logic between them.
