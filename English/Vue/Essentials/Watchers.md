# Watchers

## Basic Example​
Computed properties allow us to declaratively compute derived values. However, there are cases where we need to perform "side effects" in reaction to state changes - for example, mutating the DOM, or changing another piece of state based on the result of an async operation.\
declarative [/dɪˈklærətɪv/] 公告的，宣言的；陈述的，叙述的\
derived [/dɪˈraɪvd/] 派生的，衍生的；导出的

With Composition API, we can use the `watch` function to trigger a callback whenever a piece of reactive state changes:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'

const question = ref('')
const answer = ref('Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)')
const loading = ref(false)

// watch works directly on a ref
watch(question, async (newQuestion, oldQuestion) => {
  if (newQuestion.includes('?')) {
    loading.value = true
    answer.value = 'Thinking...'
    try {
      const res = await fetch('https://yesno.wtf/api')
      answer.value = (await res.json()).answer
    } catch (error) {
      answer.value = 'Error! Could not reach the API. ' + error
    } finally {
      loading.value = false
    }
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <p>
    Ask a yes/no question:
    <input v-model="question" :disabled="loading" />
  </p>
  <p>{{ answer }}</p>
</template>
```

### Watch Source Types​
`watch`'s first argument can be different types of reactive "sources": it can be a ref (including computed refs), a reactive object, a getter function, or an array of multiple sources:

```js
const x = ref(0)
const y = ref(0)

// single ref
watch(x, (newX) => {
  console.log(`x is ${newX}`)
})

// getter
watch(
  () => x.value + y.value,
  (sum) => {
    console.log(`sum of x + y is: ${sum}`)
  }
)

// array of multiple sources
watch([x, () => y.value], ([newX, newY]) => {
  console.log(`x is ${newX} and y is ${newY}`)
})
```
Do note that you can't watch a property of a reactive object like this:

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })

// this won't work because we are passing a number to watch()
watch(obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`)
})
```
Instead, use a getter:

```js
// instead, use a getter:
watch(
  () => obj.count,
  (count) => {
    console.log(`Count is: ${count}`)
  }
)
```
