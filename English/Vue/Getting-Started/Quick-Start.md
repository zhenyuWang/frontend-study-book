# Quick Start​
## Try Vue Online​
- To quickly get a taste of Vue, you can try it directly in our Playground.
- If you prefer a plain HTML setup without any build steps, you can use this JSFiddle as your starting point.
- If you are already familiar with Node.js and the concept of build tools, you can also try a complete build setup right within your browser on StackBlitz.
- To get a walkthrough of the recommended setup, watch this interactive Scrimba tutorial that shows you how to run, edit, and deploy your first Vue app.
